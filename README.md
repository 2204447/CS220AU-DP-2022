# CS220AU Digital Portfolio Template (2022)
## Overview
This GitHub repository is the template for the [CS220AU](https://github.com/khofstadter/CS220AU) assignment in 2022. It demonstrates minimalistic ideas for 

- project management
- web hosting with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) 
- web-design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and
- evaluation with the `assessment.md` and the `dp-checklist.md` files. 

The URL of the website can be found in the sidebar, under 'About'. The homepage uses the information in the `index.md` file.

## Portfolio items
The portfolio you submit needs to contain the following:

1. **website** (80% of your overall mark) exploring the theme given.
2. **self-and peer-assessment** (10% of your overall mark) using the marking rubric in the `assessment.md` file.
3. **portfolio overview** (10% of your overall mark) providing a succinct overview of your portfolio, an outline of completed tasks (Log) and tasks to do (TODO) in this `README.md` file.

After you finish these items, complete the `dp-checklist.md` file, download it and submit it on FASER. (Please keep this file in your repository as well after submitting.) In essence, you need to submit only one file on FASER, this `dp-checklist.md`. 

How to use this GitHub repository as a template for your submission, including how to submit your files on FASER is demonstrated in class. If anything is unclear, ask for clarification.

## Website Plan

Digital links specific to AI

How can I help others gain a better understanding of the connection between the use of their digital identities and AI? 

Keywords: 
Privacy 
Digital identities 
Social Media 
Data 

AI – artificial intelligence is software used by computers to mimic aspects of human intelligence 
(AI safety can be defined as a way to ensure that AI is deployed in ways thatdo not harm humanity) 

Digital identity – body of information about an individual, organization or electronic device that exists online
-	It’s a way to prove your identity in a safe and secure way when accessing services or completing transactions online. 
-	Removes the need to prove your identity through face-to-face interactions and physical documents 


How AI helps with privacy: 
-	Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in cybersecurity for apps 
-	Organizations use AI-based tools to better detect threats and protect their systems and data resources and thereby protecting us as well 
-	E.g., passwords, multi-factor authentication, face-recognition 

How I use AI for security (specifically looking at how my personal identities on social media) 
-	Using face-recognition 
-	Passwords which are linked to email accounts incase of breach’s 

Issues with AI and how it affects digital identities: 

Threat to privacy – unknowingly or unwillingly giving data such as your age, gender, location, and preferences 
-	Companies use your data to analyse it and customise an experience, potentially could sell your data (Website cookies) 


How is our data accessed:
-	Cameras (surveillance), smartphones, and the internet 
-	By creating digital identities on Instagram, snapchat, and TikTok we unconsciously reveal personal data 
e.g., posting pictures on social media of a place we visited or food we ate  
e.g., accepting terms and conditions without even reading it (its long and not easy to read) – google and Facebook own every message, image or video that is uploaded and could potentially sell this information to other companies 
e.g., While searching on google one cannot hide their interests – cannot search without typing the words in. Intimate interests are not private anymore: political views, sexual orientation, and health 

Why is this an issue? Data being easily accessed can lead to: 
Identity theft
-	Personal data is easily available it becomes easier for hackers to use this information to reset passwords, apply for loans 
e.g., fake accounts on Instagram, catfishing 

Phishing
- attackers can use your account/information to trick others into clicking on links or creating deceptive emails which aim to steal confidential or     corporate information 


(Regardless of being a resident or a visitor data is collected and stored about you) - introduction page will have my VR map which I will use to link to privacy later on 


(Mental health affected by digital identities? - How people portray themselves online is not them in reality) 

Survey to explore and see how many people overlook some of the important information which creates a threat to their privacy (represent the results in a pie chart using google forms) 

Survey questions: 
1.	When downloading new apps or updates do you read through the terms and conditions? 
2.	When visiting websites online do you accept all the cookies or only allow the necessary ones? 
3.	Do you use the same password for all social accounts? 
4.	How often do you update your mobile devices and laptops?  (Recent updates help in protecting data as the devices are less susceptible to viruses) 
5.

# How can I help others gain a better understanding of the connection between digital identities and an existential risk? 

## Digital Identities

  <summary>What are digital identities?</summary>
  Digital identities are a collection of data about a person or organisation that is present online. When using online services or conducting transactions, they offer a safe and secure means to prove your identity. It is no longer necessary to confirm your identification in person or with paper documents thanks to digital ID’s. Digital identities consist of personal details such as your name, birth date, email address and may require you to create a username and password for the platform your using. Examples of applications that use digital identities are Snapchat, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter etc.

  <summary>Digital engagement map</summary>
  Humanity has grown more reliant on technology, particularly cell phones and laptops, as it has developed. This dependence results in a "presence," or more accurately, a trace, being left behind. Through digital engagement, digital identities play a significant part in building these presences. A mapping method that includes visitors and residents can be used to gauge this engagement. A visitor on this map is someone who is trying to accomplish something while leaving no trace behind, such as finding information or making travel arrangements. Being a resident, on the other hand, means making the decision to use the internet and interact with others. Part of being a resident is publishing videos and images of yourself and expressing your opinion on social media creating a digital footprint. As these platforms can be used for both personal and professional purposes, there is also a personal and institutional spectrum on the map.

From my VR map I would conclude that I am more of a resident than a visitor because I spend and use more platforms for personal reasons rather than professional. However this is not to say that I am not a visitor because I do use platforms which leave no trace behind. However, I think that regardless of being a resident or a visitor data is collected and stored about humanity. This could be done through cookies from websites that I look at as a visitor or from the digital footprint I leave behind as resident.

## Existential risk - AGI 

### Existential risk is defined as a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity in the long-term. The advancement of technology or specifically artificial intelligence has led to many saying that 'AI will take over the world'.

  <summary>What is AGI?</summary>
  AGI, also known as Artificial General Intelligence, is software with human cognitive abilities which enables it to solve problems when presented with a new task. Its goal is to carry out every task that a human being is capable of. Characteristics that an AGI has is common sense, background and transfer knowledge, abstract thinking and causality.  

   A very well-known form AGI is self-driving cars. 
  More examples of AGI can be found [here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/artificial-general-intelligence-AGI#:~:text=IBM's%20Watson%20supercomputer%2C%20expert%20systems,examples%20of%20narrow%20artificial%20intelligence)

  <summary>How is AGI an existential risk?</summary>
  All AI have access to enormous amounts of data, which AGI uses to gather knowledge, comprehend situations, and develop solutions just like a person would. When AGI undergoes an "intelligence explosion" and develops the capacity to design and alter both other machines and itself, it poses a massive threat. AGI would be capable of realising that humans pose the greatest harm to themselves, and it would “take matters into its own hand” in this situation with the ability to edit or control other machines. It may find humans to be a burden or believe that we are detrimental to the moral advancement of the cosmos and therefore plan our extinction.

## Link between AGI and Digital Identities

  <summary>Threats to AGI and Digital Identities</summary>
  There is no direct connection between digital identities and AGI, since AGI is regarded as an existential risk it can also be seen as a threat to digital identities. To understand the indirect link between AGI and digital identities we can look at the biggest threats to digital identities. 
This is when people obtain access to private information, when businesses use cookies to sell or buy data, and being monitored.

    <summary>Threat to privacy</summary>
    Companies will use the information you consciously or unknowingly provide about your age, gender, location, and preferences to analyse it and customise your experience or they may sell your data in the form of website cookies.

    <summary>How is our data accessed?</summary>
      Smartphones, the internet, and surveillance cameras are used to access our data. By creating digital identities on TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat, we unwittingly reveal personal information.
  
e.g., posting pictures on social media of a place we visited or food we ate.   
e.g., accepting terms and conditions without even reading it (its long and not easy to read) – google and Facebook own every message, image or video that is uploaded and could potentially sell this information to other companies.
e.g., While searching on google one cannot hide their interests – cannot search without typing the words in. Intimate interests are not private anymore: political views, sexual orientation, and health.

<details>
  <summary>Data being easily accessed can lead to</summary>
  Identity theft: It's simple to access personal information, hackers can use this information to apply for loans and reset passwords with ease.  
e.g., fake accounts on Instagram, catfishing 

Phishing:
Attackers may use your account and information to send misleading emails or entice people to click on links in order to steal sensitive information from  you and your company.

  <summary>What does this mean for AGI and digital identities?</summary>
  
 As AGI is created to solve problems where human efficiency is low. As mentioned before AGI is trying to replicate the humans mind in thought process. This means that it would most likely be used to solve some of the planets biggest problems such as climate change, world hunger and wars and military conflict. The AGI would recognise that we are the cause of our own problems and therefore may decide that the survival of the human species is not needed or choose a select few to continue on the species. 

AGI was developed to address issues where humans are inefficient. AGI is attempting to mimic the way the human mind thinks, as was previously mentioned. This indicates that technology would likely be employed to address some of the planet's most pressing issues, including global warming, starvation, war, and armed conflict. The AGI would understand that we are the root of our own problems and might determine that it is not necessary for the human species to survive or may choose a small number of individuals to carry on the species. Similar to this, AGI may be used to address the dangers to our digital identity's privacy, but doing so may also reveal how vindictive and destructive human beings are, as well as the reality that they will go to any lengths to make money, including stealing your data even if doing so compromises you. The process will then be repeated.
